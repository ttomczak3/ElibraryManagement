## How To Use

#### Clone the repository:

```
    git clone https://github.com/ttomczak3/ludwig-jam.git
```

Once you clone the repository into your Visual Studio, you'll need to create your database next. You'll need MSSQL and SSMS downloaded when creating the database and the tables for the project. Make sure to create the database and tables with the corresponding names, or it won't work. When you finish creating your database, you'll need to change the connection string name to your server name in the Web.config file.

> The highlights are what you need to change in the Web.config file.
